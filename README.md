In this project, I reviewed and modified file and directory permissions in a Linux environment to ensure only
authorized users had proper access. This task simulated real-world system hardening by identifying overly
permissive settings and locking down access for users outside the research team. The goal was to align with
organizational security standards and restrict write access where not explicitly authorized.
